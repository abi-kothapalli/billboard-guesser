  "description": "Congrats!! You have been selected to engage in the next step of the Change++ application process. The next step in our process is completing the following coding project. As we are unable to offer interviews to every applicant, we will use this challenge to evaluate a number of criteria including technical skills and commitment to Change++. We expect this to take between 2-6 hours depending on experience level and technical skills. You will have approximately one week to complete the challenge. We recognize that you are all busy, but as a member of a Change++ team it is expected that you will dedicate 4-6 hours every week working on your project; therefore, we believe this is a reasonable timeframe.",
